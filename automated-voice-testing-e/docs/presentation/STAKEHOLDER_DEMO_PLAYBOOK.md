# Stakeholder Demo Playbook

This playbook outlines the structure, flow, and preparation required to deliver a compelling end-to-end demonstration of the automated testing platform for business and technical stakeholders.

## Agenda

- **Welcome & objectives (5 min)** – recap pilot goals and highlight desired stakeholder outcomes.
- **Platform overview (5 min)** – narrate the current architecture, validation workflow, and dashboard improvements.
- **Live demo (20 min)** – walk through validator experience, test execution orchestration, and reporting.
- **Roadmap & success metrics (5 min)** – showcase Phase 2 achievements and preview Phase 3 priorities.
- **Q&A and next steps (15 min)** – open discussion, collect commitments, and confirm follow-up expectations.

## Live Demo Script

1. **Authentication & landing** – log in with demo credentials and highlight the personalized dashboard widgets.
2. **Test case management** – open a regression test case, show version history with rollback support, and demonstrate language tabs.
3. **Validation workflow** – claim a pending validation via the queue widget, perform validation with keyboard shortcuts and timer, and submit the decision.
4. **CI/CD visibility** – navigate to the CI/CD status widget, review active pipelines, and drill into a run’s pipeline visualization.
5. **Analytics & reporting** – display real-time execution metrics, validation accuracy trends, and defect tracking insights.
6. **Translation & ML enhancements** – briefly mention translation workflow, semantic scoring, and ML-driven validation scoring for future scalability.

## Q&A Preparation

- **Audience research** – catalog attendees, their roles, and anticipated concerns (e.g., compliance, integration effort, validator workload).
- **Key talking points** – prepare concise answers for security posture, data quality, ROI timeline, and operational impact.
- **Demo resilience** – maintain a backup data set, screenshots, and recorded demo in case of connectivity issues.
- **Facilitation plan** – assign moderator to triage questions, capture action items in a shared document, and timebox deep dives.

## Follow-Up Actions

- Summarize decisions, commitments, and outstanding questions within 24 hours.
- Share recording, slide deck, and supporting documentation via the stakeholder distribution list.
- Log feedback into the Phase 3 backlog, tagging items as bugs, feature requests, or operational improvements.
- Schedule follow-up workshops (e.g., integration kickoff, validator onboarding) based on stakeholder interest.

Call to Action: Confirm stakeholder availability, rehearse the demo with the core team, and align on responsibilities before going live.

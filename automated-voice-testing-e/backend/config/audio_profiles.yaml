# Audio Simulation Profiles (TASK-118)
#
# This configuration file defines audio simulation profiles for testing
# voice AI systems under various acoustic conditions. Each profile specifies:
#   - snr_db: Signal-to-noise ratio in decibels (higher = cleaner audio)
#   - background_noise: Type of background noise to simulate (null = no noise)
#
# Profiles are used to simulate real-world acoustic environments and test
# voice AI robustness under different conditions.

# Clean profile: Ideal acoustic conditions
# - High SNR (25 dB) for clear audio
# - No background noise
# Use for: Baseline testing, optimal conditions
clean:
  snr_db: 25
  background_noise: null

# Moderate profile: Typical indoor environment
# - Medium SNR (20 dB)
# - Car ambient noise simulation
# Use for: Realistic testing, in-vehicle scenarios
moderate:
  snr_db: 20
  background_noise: "car_ambient"

# High noise profile: Challenging acoustic conditions
# - Low SNR (15 dB)
# - Highway traffic noise simulation
# Use for: Stress testing, noisy environments
high_noise:
  snr_db: 15
  background_noise: "highway_traffic"
